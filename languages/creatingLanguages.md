To create a language file to be used in the program, follow the steps below.

1. Create a new file with an appropriate name.
2. On the first row, give the language a name.
3. On the second row, enter the two languages used seperated by a '-', i.e. Swedish-Korean
4. For each row, enter the word and its translation separated by a ':'.

When finished, save the file and upload it using the "Words" modal. You should now be able to use the language in the program.
